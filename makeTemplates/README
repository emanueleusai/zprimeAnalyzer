The main code to make histograms is "doThetaTemplates.py":
To be modified by user (listed in the order as they appear in the script):
	- input directory (step1 or step2)
	- list of samples to be run for signals, backgrounds, and data
	- group the background processes into "ewk", "qcd", "top", "ttjets", 
	  etc (no need to modify unless samples and thus their names change).
	- systematics: they have to be defined in "analyze.py" and corresponding samples must exist.
	  The systematics can be turned off if only simple plots wanted without total uncertainty bands
	  or only considering the normalization uncertainties in the limit calculation!
	- Give the list of cuts to be applied! New cuts can be included in "cutList" as long as
	  they are also added in "analyze.py" to "cut" string and also add it to "cutString" variable in "doTemplates.py"
	- modify the output directory names, etc
	- modify the normalization uncertainties
	- give the discriminants in "plotList" (given near the end). In the definition, give a name to distribution 
	  as a key to the dictionary, name of the variable in input trees, x-axis label, and the desired binning
